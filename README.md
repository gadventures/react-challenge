# React Challenge

Thank you for your interest in joining G Adventures.
This challenge will allow us to further evaluate where you may potentially fit from
a technical perspective. Nothing too complicated. We want you to go over the code
with us. We can then discuss different areas of React. We're really excited!

## Getting Started
First, clone this repository from Github. Once it's clonned you can go ahead and install all requirements and run the project

```
$ cd react-challenge 
$ npm install
$ npm start run
```

That's it. Let's go over the code together now.
